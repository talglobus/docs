## What does it do?

If-else nodes, as the name suggests, allow you to create conditional logic in your Wordapp. This means you can make your
Wordapp do different things based on the content it's generated so far, or the inputs it's received.

If-else nodes give Wordapps the ability to make decisions, and sit at the heart of the intelligence AI provides. With Wordware,
you can trivially pass data back and forth between software and AI, leveraging whichever form of intelligence is best for each point
of your workflow.

<Note>Did you know that Wordapps are [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)? The combination of if-else nodes and [loop](/nodes/loop) nodes
    make Wordapps capable of carrying out any computation a computer can!</Note>

## How do I use it?

An if-else node is made up of a series of conditions, each with a corresponding action. When the node runs, it checks each condition in turn,
running the nodes inside the first section where the condition is true.

To create an if-else node, type `/if` in the editor, and hit `Enter`. You'll be prompted to fill in some details about the node,
like its name, and the conditions and actions you want to include.

### Conditions

Conditions are set in the sidebar under the
**Expressions** section, with each condition (**IF**) having two slots for inputs, and three ways to compare them:

| Comparison | How it works                                                                          |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Match      | Checks if the two values are equal                                                    |
| Contains   | Checks if the first value contains the second value                                   |
| Relative   | Compares two numeric inputs, with sub-options for the comparison operator (e.g. \>, \<) |

The **Match** and **Contains** comparison types also have toggles for case sensitivity and how to treat symbols and whitespace.

You can add as many conditions as you like with the **ADD IF +** button below all the existing conditions. There's also an **ELSE** condition, which runs if none of the other conditions are true.

### Actions

Actions are set in the editor under the appropriate condition, allowing for generations, mentions, and any other
node types to be run depending on which condition is true.

The if-else example above, for example, works as follows:

<Steps>
    <Step title="If">
        First, the **IF** condition checks if the `@is_known_user` mention is the text "true". If so, the Wordapp will run the nodes inside this section:
        <Frame>
            ![If Action](/images/nodes/if-else/if-action.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Else">
        Then, if the above condition _is not met_, the Wordapp will run the nodes inside this section:
        <Frame>
            ![Else Action](/images/nodes/if-else/else-action.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>
