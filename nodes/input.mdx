## What does it do?

Inputs are the data that your Wordapp uses to generate content. Currently, we support text and images as inputs. You can
use them to provide context for your AI models, or to give them something to work with.

When you run a Wordapp, you will be asked to provide values for your output for this particular run. If you access your
Wordapp via API, you'll need to provide these values in your request.

## How do I use it?

Inputs live in the input bar, just above the start of your prompt in the editor.

To add an input, you can:
- Click the `+ Add` button in the input bar
- Type `/input` in the editor and hit `Enter`
- Type `@` and a name for the new input in the editor, then hit `Enter`

### Options

A number of options appear in the sidebar when you create a new input. Here's what they mean:

#### Name

The name of the input. You'll need this later if you want to reference the input in your prompt.

#### Description

A description of the input. This can be useful for keeping track of what each input is for, but is not required. It's
also not visible to the AI models in a [generation](/nodes/generation).

#### Input Type

What values are allowed for this input. You can choose between:

| Input type | What it's for                                                                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Text       | A short word or phrase                                                            |
| Long Text  | A longer snippet of text, potentially multiple paragraphs                         |
| Image      | An image, helpful if you're using AI models with vision capabilities, like GPT-4o |

### Outputs

While it's not technically an output, the value of an input can be referenced in your prompt the same as any other output.
