## What does it do?

Human asks allow you to ask for input from a human during the execution of your Wordapp. This is useful whenever you
need to stop and wait on a human for information, like asking for a decision, a piece of information, or a preference.

## How do I use it?

A human ask takes a request for the human to respond to in the editor. When you run the Wordapp, the human will be
prompted to fill in the request, with execution pausing until the human responds, and the response will be available
for any later steps.

To create a human ask, type `/human` in the editor, and hit `Enter`. Then choose a name in the sidebar.

### Options

A few options appear in the sidebar when you create a human ask. Here's what they mean:

#### Name

The name of the human ask for later [@mentioning](/nodes/mention).

#### Include output in prompt

Whether or not to include the human's response in the prompt for later steps. This can be useful if you want the model
to immediately respond to the human's input, for example, in chatbots. It's also useful in debugging, as you can see the
human's response in the prompt.

<Note>

    Enabling this toggle is equivalent to adding a [@mention](/nodes/mention) for the human ask node just below. The
    only meaningful difference is it keeps the flow less cluttered by hiding the mention node.

### Outputs

#### `response`

The response from the human. This is the text that the human provides in response to the provided request
