## What does it do?

Loops let you conditionally repeat parts of your Wordapp. You can use them to create complex interactions, like asking
the user for input until they give you the right answer, or generating content until it meets a certain criteria.

Loops are a powerful tool for creating dynamic, interactive Wordapps. They let you build complex logic into your Wordapp,
and can help you create more engaging and useful experiences. They also let you take advantage of the full power of AI,
by allowing you to iterate on the content it generates. This pattern lives at the core of every agent.

We've got some examples of how to make the most of loops in our recipes, specifically the [chatbot](/recipes/chatbots)
and [basic agent](/recipes/basic-agent) recipes.

## How do I use it?

A loop has two parts, a condition and an action. The condition determines how long to repeat the action, and the action
is what you want to repeat.

To create a loop, type `/loop` in the editor, and hit `Enter`. You'll be prompted to fill in a name and the condition
and action for the loop.

### Options

A number of options appear in the sidebar when you create a loop. Here's what they mean:

#### Name

The name of the loop. You'll need this later if you want to [@mention](/nodes/mention) the output of the loop.

#### Type

There are five types of condition you can use to determine when to stop the loop:

| Condition type | How it works                                                                                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Count          | Stops after a fixed number of iterations                                                           |
| Match          | Stops when two values are equal, typically at least one a [@mention](/nodes/mention) set elsewhere |
| Contains       | Stops when one value contains another, used for text comparisons                                   |
| Relative       | Compares two numeric inputs, with sub-options for the comparison operator (e.g. \>, \<)            |
| List           | Loops once for every element in a list, giving the action each such element, one at a time         |


A generation takes all the data that's appeared in the Wordapp so far and passes it to your AI model of choice. The
model then generates new content based on what it's seen.

To create a generation, type `/generation` in the editor, and hit `Enter`. You'll be prompted to fill in some details
about the generation, like its name and the model you want to use, further explained below. Once you run the Wordapp,
the model will be fed all the content above the generation and generate new content based on it, which you can then
reference with a [@mention](/nodes/mention).

### Outputs

Loops produce a list-type output, containing all the outputs produced from the action of the loop.
