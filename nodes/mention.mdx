## What does it do?

Mentions allow you to include previously generated content, as well as [inputs](/nodes/input), the outputs of other
[prompts](/nodes/prompt), and even the code used in a [code execution](/nodes/code-execution).

This can be useful for creating complex interactions between different parts of your Wordapp, or for building on
previous outputs. Almost every Wordapp will use mentions at some point.


## How do I use it?

Start by typing `@` in the editor. This will bring up a list of all the available mentions. You can then type to filter
down to the mention you want, and press `Enter` to select it.

In the runner, the mention will be replaced with the content it references. Any [generations](/nodes/generation) that
appear after the mention will be able to see the content as if it were part of the prompt.
